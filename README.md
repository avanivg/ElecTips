# ElecTips
ElecTips encourages motorists to make the switch to electric vehicles by promoting a sense of community among drivers of electric vehicles. Users can input the distance they are traveling to calculate the ideal speed to drive at for perfect fuel efficiency. Users can also compete with their peers via the Leaderboard to see who is the savviest driver. ElecTips also calculates costs saved by driving an electric vehicle versus a traditional petroleum vehicle.
Come get electric with ElecTips!
# Inspiration
We were inspired to build this app for Toyota's challenge at WE Hack 2022. We feel passionately about alternative sources of energy and improving transportation for all, especially in a large metropolis like the DFW area. 
# Building ElecTip
Grace worked back-end, optimizing Firebase services for ElecTip. Shagun and Avani worked as front-end developers to build a comprehensive UI/UX for ElecTip. We used Flutter and Dart to build the app for Android. 
# Future Improvements
In the future, we'd like to work out a more accurate formula for calculating the ideal speed for perfect fuel efficiency by accounting for traffic conditions, speed limits in the driver's area, and internal vehicle factors like A/C. We'd also like to incorporate a real-time gas prices API based on driver location to more accurately calculate cost savings and account for variances in prices across states and cities. We also envision a "Maintenance" page to remind vehicle owners when it's time to perform maintenance tasks like battery changes, tire rotations/pressure readings, air filter changes, etc.
We hope ElecTip will make it easier for drivers to choose, maintain, and enjoy electric vehicles. Thanks again to WEHack and Toyota!
